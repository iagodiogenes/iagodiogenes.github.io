As a Linux user I won't try to fool you, I already spent a lot of time looking for small fixes to annoying little bugs or maybe that one-liner that makes a complicated task much easier. 

Then, after a few times repeating the same researches, I started making a list of these tricks and solutions. In case it's helpful for anyone, here are some cool Linux tricks:

# Delete a line cointaing some specific text

```cpp
find . -name "*.sh" -type f | xargs sed -i -e '/compute_bound/d'
```

# Split a .txt file into multiple new files

`42` — number of lines on each file

`CampaignSet21.sh` — file to split

`CSet21-` — new files preffix

```cpp
split -l 42 --numeric-suffixes CampaignSet21.sh CSet21- --additional-suffix=.sh
```

# Find anything inside various txt files

Here are the switches: 

**-i** → ignore text case 

**-R** → recursively search files in subdirectories.

**-l** → show file names instead of file contents portions.

**./** → the last parameter is the path to the folder containing files you need to search for your text. In our case, it is the current folder with the file mask. You can change it to the full path of the folder.

```bash
grep -iRl "your-text-to-find" ./
```

# Change permissions

chown

The example below gives permission to the user **iagodiogenes ****to the folder **build** and everything within.

```bash
sudo chown -R iagodiogenes build/
```

# Creating alias

In the file .bashrc you can create aliases for any bash command, for example:

```bash
alias matlab_free='/usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a/bin/./matlab -softwareopengl'
```

# Check file size

du command

`du -h`

`du -d 1`
